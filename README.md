## General Introduction

Gotthard tunnel is present since 1980, and connects Göschenen (Canton Uri) with Airolo (Ticino).
It's aim was to connect the northern and the southern axis of Switerlans, with benefits on trade and tourism. 
This tunnel is ever since know for the huge traffic jams created by the elevated amounts of traffics and occasionally by accidents. 
To avoid those problematics a system called "dropper" grants a safety distance between heavy vehicles according to cars traffic.

The aim of this project is to study the developing of traffic on this particular piece of highway (A2), so that is possible to understand:

1.	If the “dropper” system is efficient.
2.	If the waiting hours are due to imposed speed limits, and if which increment or diminuition of the speed limit should be introduced.
3.	How the affluence of traffic in the winter and summer periods are influenced from the opening of the mountain pass.


## The Model

The variables we want to analyze with our model are:

-	The influence on the traffic due to the speed limit
-	The influene on the traffic due to the dropper system
-	How the mountain pass helps the traffic in the tunnel


## Fundamental Questions

The foundamental questions are: 

1.  Which change in the speed limit is optimal for the fluidity of traffic?
2.  Is the “CONTAGOCCE” system helpful?
3   Would be useful to keep open the mountain pass longer?


## Expected Results

We expect that the actual system is already quite well optimized. But a longer opening of the pass would signifiantly increase the fluidity.


## References 

Currently our references are research carried out on the internet on the following sites:

In the course of the project we will see new sources in order to gather as much material as possible and make the study as close as possible to reality


## Research Methods

We think we need continuous modeling, but we aren’t sure yet.
